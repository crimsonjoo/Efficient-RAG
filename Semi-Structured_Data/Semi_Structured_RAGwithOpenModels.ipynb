The family includes Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes for various applications. The Ultra model sets new standards in 30 of 32 benchmarks, including human-expert performance on MMLU, and outperforms in all 20 multimodal benchmarks. The new capabilities of Gemini models in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding are expected to enable numerous use cases.', '\\n\\nIn summary, Gemini is a family of highly capable multimodal models developed at Google, which achieves new state-of-the-art results in various benchmarks across text, image, audio, and video domains. It is available in three sizes, each tailored to different computational limitations and application requirements. The most capable model, Gemini Ultra, achieves human-expert performance on several benchmarks and demonstrates impressive crossmodal reasoning capabilities.', '\\n\\n2.1 Model Architecture\\n\\nGemini is a family of multimodal models that can process text, code, images, audio, and video. It is based on the T5 architecture (Raffel et al., 2020), which is a text-to-text transformer model that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of tasks. The T5 architecture consists of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input and generates a sequence of hidden states, and the decoder generates the output based on these hidden states. The encoder and decoder share the same weights, allowing for efficient fine-tuning on various tasks.\\n\\nTo enable multimodal processing, we extend the T5 architecture by adding specialized attention mechanisms for each modality. For text, we use a standard self-attention mechanism. For code, we use a code attention mechanism that can process code tokens and identify the dependencies between them. For images, we use a visual attention mechanism that can focus on specific regions of an image. For audio and video, we use a temporal attention mechanism that can process the temporal dependencies between frames or audio samples.\\n\\nThe Gemini model family consists of several sizes, ranging from small to large models. The small models, such as Gemini Nano, have fewer than 100 million parameters, making them suitable for on-device deployment. The larger models, such as Gemini XL, have over 1 billion parameters and are designed for cloud deployment.\\n\\n2.2 Training Infrastructure and Dataset\\n\\nGemini is trained on a large-scale multimodal dataset, which includes text, code, images, audio, and video. The text portion of the dataset is based on the Common Crawl dataset (Manning et al., 2008), which contains web pages and text from various sources. The code portion of the dataset is based on public code repositories, such as GitHub and Bitbucket. The image portion of the dataset is based on large-scale image datasets, such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and COCO (Lin et al., 2014). The audio and video portions of the dataset are based on large-scale audio and video datasets, such as LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015) and LRW (Liu et al., 2019).\\n\\nTo train Gemini, we use a combination of distributed training and model parallelism. Distributed training allows us to train the model on multiple GPUs, while model parallelism allows us to split the model across multiple GPUs. This allows us to train large models at scale, while keeping the memory requirements per GPU manageable.\\n\\n2.3 Evaluation\\n\\nWe evaluate the performance of Gemini on a range of benchmarks and human-preference evaluations. In the following sections, we present the results of these evaluations, covering text, code, image, audio, and video tasks.\\n\\n2.3.1 Text\\n\\nWe evaluate the text processing capabilities of Gemini on several benchmarks, including the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmarks.

We approach responsible deployment through a three-step process: impact assessments, developing model policies, and evaluations and mitigations of harm.\\n\\n2.4.1 Impact Assessments\\n\\nBefore deploying a new AI system, we conduct thorough impact assessments to understand the potential positive and negative consequences of the system. This includes assessing the system’s impact on users, society, and the environment. We also consider the ethical implications of the system, such as privacy, fairness, and transparency.\\n\\n2.4.2 Model Policies\\n\\nWe develop model policies to guide the behavior of our AI systems. These policies are based on our values and principles, and are designed to ensure that our systems are safe, fair, and beneficial to users. For example, we have policies in place to prevent our systems from generating harmful or offensive content.\\n\\n2.4.3 Evaluations and Mitigations of Harm\\n\\nWe regularly evaluate the performance of our AI systems to identify and mitigate any negative consequences. This includes monitoring the system’s behavior in production, and conducting regular audits and testing to identify and address any issues. We also have processes in place to address any negative consequences that may arise, such as providing users with clear and transparent explanations of the system’s behavior, and offering users the ability to opt out of the system if they choose to do so.\\n\\n2.5 Conclusion\\n\\nGemini is a family of multimodal models that can process text, code, images, audio, and video. It is based on the T5 architecture, and is trained on a large-scale multimodal dataset. Gemini achieves strong performance on a range of benchmarks and human-preference evaluations, demonstrating its ability to process and reason about text, code, images, audio, and video. We also discuss our approach to responsible deployment, which includes impact assessments, model policies, and evaluations and mitigations of harm.\\n\\nGemini represents a significant step forward in the development of multimodal AI systems, and paves the way for a new era of research and innovation in AI. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed, such as improving the efficiency and scalability of multimodal models, and addressing the ethical and societal implications of AI systems. We look forward to continuing to work on these challenges, and to contributing to the development of a responsible and beneficial AI ecosystem.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDeng, L., Deng, L., Yu, D., Deng, L., Yu, D., Deng, L.,... & Fei-Fei, L.

The Pro model is the most capable and delivers state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks. The Performance model is performance-optimized and cost-effective. The Nano models are designed for on-device use and come in two versions, Nano-1 and Nano-2, with 1.8B and 3.25B parameters respectively. Gemini models support interleaved text, image, audio, and video inputs and can output responses with interleaved image and text. They can handle variable input resolution and directly ingest audio signals at 16kHz from USM features.

Introduction\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce Gemini, a family of multimodal models that can process and generate text, images, and other modalities. We describe the architecture, training data, and key design choices that enable Gemini to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a diverse set of benchmarks. We also discuss the implications of these results for the future of AI research and applications.\\n\\n6.2. Architecture\\n\\nGemini is a multimodal model that can process and generate text, images, and other modalities. It is based on a transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which has shown remarkable success in natural language processing tasks. The transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each with multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks. The encoder processes the input text or image, while the decoder generates the output text or image.\\n\\nTo enable multimodal processing, we extend the transformer architecture to handle multiple input modalities. Specifically, we add separate input embeddings for text and images, and we use a separate attention mechanism for each modality. The text and image embeddings are combined using a cross-modal embedding layer, which allows the model to learn the relationship between the two modalities. The attention mechanisms for each modality are then combined using a cross-attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to both modalities simultaneously.\\n\\n6.3. Training Data\\n\\nGemini is trained on a large and diverse dataset of text and images, which includes web text, books, and image captions. The text data is preprocessed using standard techniques such as tokenization and lowercasing, while the image data is preprocessed using techniques such as resizing and normalization. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, with the training set being the largest and most diverse.\\n\\nTo enable multimodal training, we use a combination of text-only and multimodal training data. The text-only data consists of pairs of input text and output text, while the multimodal data consists of input text, input images, and output text. The multimodal data is collected using a variety of methods, including web scraping, image search engines, and manual curation.\\n\\n6.4. Key Design Choices\\n\\nThere are several key design choices that enable Gemini to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a diverse set of benchmarks.\\n\\nFirst, we use a large and diverse dataset of text and images for training. This allows the model to learn the relationship between the two modalities and to generalize well to new data.\\n\\nSecond, we use a transformer architecture with separate attention mechanisms for each modality and a cross-modal embedding layer to combine the text and image embeddings. This allows the model to attend to both modalities simultaneously and to learn the relationship between them.\\n\\nThird, we use a combination of text-only and multimodal training data. This allows the model to learn to generate text given text input and to learn to generate text given both text and image input.\\n\\nFourth, we use a chain-of-thought prompting approach to account for model uncertainty. This involves generating a chain of thought with multiple samples and selecting the answer based on consensus among the samples. This approach improves performance on benchmarks that require specialist knowledge and reasoning.\\n\\n6.5. Implications\\n\\nThe results presented in this paper have several implications for the future of AI research and applications.\\n\\nFirst, they demonstrate the potential of multimodal models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a diverse set of benchmarks. This has important implications for applications such as multimodal search engines, multimodal assistants, and multimodal content generation.\\n\\nSecond, they highlight the importance of large and diverse training data for achieving high performance on complex benchmarks. This has implications for the development of future AI systems and the need for large and diverse datasets to train them.\\n\\nThird, they demonstrate the value of using a chain-of-thought prompting approach to account for model uncertainty. This approach can improve performance on benchmarks that require specialist knowledge and reasoning, and it has implications for the development of more robust and reliable AI systems.\\n\\n4.

Discussion and Future Work\\n\\nThe Gemini models presented in this paper represent a significant step forward in the development of multimodal LLMs. However, there are still several challenges and opportunities for future work.\\n\\nFirst, as mentioned earlier, the evaluation of LLMs on standardized benchmarks is an ongoing challenge. The susceptibility of benchmark results to pretraining dataset composition and leaked data highlights the need for more robust and nuanced evaluation methods. One potential solution is to develop evaluation benchmarks that are specifically designed to test the capabilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios, such as conversational applications or educational settings.\\n\\nSecond, the Gemini models presented in this paper are based on a transformer architecture. While this architecture has proven to be highly effective for LLMs, there are other architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that may be better suited for certain tasks, such as text generation or conversational applications. Exploring the potential of these architectures for multimodal LLMs is an important area for future research.\\n\\nThird, the Gemini models presented in this paper are trained on a large pretraining dataset. However, the cost and environmental impact of training such large models is a significant concern. One potential solution is to explore the use of smaller models or model distillation techniques to reduce the computational requirements while maintaining performance.\\n\\nFourth, the Gemini models presented in this paper are text-based. However, there are many other modalities, such as images, audio, and video, that can be used to represent and process information. Developing multimodal LLMs that can effectively process and integrate information from multiple modalities is an important area for future research.\\n\\nFifth, the Gemini models presented in this paper are primarily focused on text generation and reasoning tasks. However, there are many other applications, such as translation, summarization, and question answering, that can benefit from multimodal LLMs. Exploring the potential of multimodal LLMs for these applications is an important area for future research.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Gemini family of models represents a significant step forward in the development of multimodal LLMs. However, there are still several challenges and opportunities for future work. Addressing these challenges and exploring the potential of multimodal LLMs in real-world applications will undoubtedly lead to even more advanced and capable models in the future.\\n\\n5.

Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduced Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models that can perform a wide range of tasks across different modalities, including text, image, video, and audio. We discussed the design and architecture of the models, and provided extensive evaluation of their performance on various benchmarks and tasks. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including text classification, math problem solving, coding, image classification, object detection, action recognition, speech recognition, text-to-speech, music generation, and multimodal reasoning. The models also demonstrate strong performance in discerning fine-grained details in inputs, aggregating context across space and time, and applying these capabilities over a temporally-related sequence of video frames and/or audio inputs. The models are natively multimodal and exhibit the unique ability to seamlessly combine their capabilities across modalities. The models also show strong performance in combining information across different modalities to make a decision or generate an output.

Factuality\\n\\nWe mitigate factuality harms by training models on factuality-preserving data and by using factuality-preserving instruction tuning. We use a combination of factuality-preserving datasets, such as the Factuality Dataset (Zellers et al., 2019), and factuality-preserving instruction tuning, such as the Factuality Instruction Tuning Dataset (Zellers et al., 2020). We also use a factuality-preserving reward model, which is trained on a factuality-preserving dataset, to further improve factuality.\\n\\nWe also use a factuality-preserving instruction tuning recipe, which is designed to balance the objective of model output response being factual versus being helpful. We use a multi-objective optimization with a weighted sum of reward scores from factuality, helpfulness, and safety, to train a multi-headed reward model.\\n\\nWe further elaborate our approach to mitigate risks of factuality harms. We enumerate approximately 10 factuality harm types (e.g. misinformation, incorrect answers, false claims) across a wide variety of use cases. We generate a dataset of potential factuality-harming queries in these categories, either manually by policy experts and ML engineers, or via prompting high capability language models with topical keywords as seeds.\\n\\nGiven the factuality-harming queries, we probe our Gemini models and analyze the model responses via side-by-side evaluation. We balance the objective of model output response being factual versus being helpful. From the detected factuality risk areas, we create additional supervised fine-tuning data to demonstrate the desirable responses. To generate such responses at scale, we heavily rely on a custom data generation recipe inspired from Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b), where we inject variants of factuality-preserving instructions as “constitutions”, and utilize language model’s strong zero-shot reasoning abilities (Kojima et al., 2022) to revise responses and choose between multiple response candidates. We have found this recipe to be effective – for example in Gemini Pro, this overall recipe was able to mitigate a majority of our identified factuality harm cases, without any perceptible decrease on response helpfulness.\\n\\nIn summary, we mitigate model harms through a combination of data curation, instruction tuning, and factuality preservation. We take steps to mitigate potential downstream harms at the data curation and data collection stage, carefully design instruction tuning recipes to balance helpfulness and harm reduction, and use factuality-preserving datasets and instruction tuning to mitigate factuality harms. We also use a multi-objective optimization approach to train a multi-headed reward model to balance the objectives of helpfulness, factuality, and safety. We iteratively evaluate and re-run evaluations following mitigation efforts.', '\\n\\nTable 14: Comparison of Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro (no factuality adaptation) on three key factuality-related evaluation sets.\\n\\n| Evaluation Set | Gemini Pro (no factuality adaptation) | Gemini Pro |\\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------|\\n| Factuality Set | 12.3% inaccuracy                      | 6.1% inac- curacy |\\n| Attribution Set | 33.3% accuracy                       | 50.0% accu- racy |\\n| Hedging Set    | 0%                                   | 70.0%        |\\n\\nThese results demonstrate that our factuality-focused adaptation significantly improves the factuality of Gemini Pro in a variety of scenarios.\\n\\n6.5. Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduced Gemini, a family of multimodal models that can perform a wide range of tasks, including summarization, translation, and factuality-focused response generation. We demonstrated that Gemini Pro, a variant of Gemini, outperforms state-of-the-art models on a variety of benchmarks, including the Multi30k, CNN-Dailymail, and XSum datasets. We also introduced a factuality-focused adaptation to Gemini Pro, which significantly improves the factuality of the model in a variety of scenarios.\\n\\nWe believe that Gemini represents a significant step forward in the development of multimodal models that can perform a wide range of tasks while maintaining a high degree of factuality. We hope that this work will inspire further research in this area and lead to the development of even more capable and trustworthy multimodal models.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBrown, J. L., et al. (2020).

The most capable model, Gemini Ultra, sets new state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of benchmarks in natural language and multimodal domains. The new capabilities of Gemini models enable new applications in education, problem solving, multilingual communication, information summarization, extraction, and creativity. However, there are limitations to the use of LLMs, including the need for ongoing research on \"hallucinations\" and the struggle with high-level reasoning abilities.

you. It's a acknowledgement or thank you note from the creators of a project called Gemini at Google. They express their gratitude to numerous teams and individuals at Google for their support and contributions to the project. The list includes names of people from various teams such as AlphaCode, Borg Scheduling, Facilities, Gemini Demo Team, Global Server Ops (GSO), JAX, Legal, ML SRE, ML Supercomputer (MLSC), PartIR, Platforms Infrastructure Engineering (PIE), and XLA Compiler. They also mention a few individuals by name. The text concludes by acknowledging the contributions of those not explicitly mentioned in the list.\", '\\n\\nThe table above summarizes the comparison of chain-of-thought approaches on the MMLU benchmark between Gemini Ultra and GPT-4. The proposed uncertainty-routed chain-of-thought approach, where the model produces k chain-of-thought samples, selects the majority vote if the model is confident above a threshold, and otherwise defers to the greedy sample choice, is contrasted with the greedy sampling approach. The thresholds are optimized for each model based on their validation split performance. The results show that Gemini Ultra benefits more from this approach compared to using only chain-of-thought samples, improving its performance significantly from 84.0% with greedy sampling to 90.0% with uncertainty-routed chain-of-thought approach with 32 samples. GPT-4, on the other hand, already achieves similar gains from using 32 chain-of-thought samples only, improving its performance from 84.2% with greedy sampling to 87.3% with uncertainty-routed chain-of-thought approach with 32 samples. The figure illustrates the score improvements for both models.', '\\n\\nThis text summarizes the capabilities and benchmarking tasks used to evaluate the Gemini models across various domains such as text, image, audio, and video.

Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduced Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models that can understand and generate text, images, and code. We presented the design and architecture of Gemini models, which are based on a modular and extensible framework that allows for easy integration of new capabilities and modalities. We demonstrated the versatility and effectiveness of Gemini models through a range of qualitative examples, including chart understanding and reasoning, image understanding and reasoning, image generation and multilingual understanding, and complex multimodal reasoning tasks involving image understanding, code generation, and instruction following.\\n\\nGemini models represent a significant step forward in the development of multimodal AI systems, as they are able to handle a wide range of multimodal tasks and modalities with high accuracy and efficiency. We believe that Gemini models will have a wide range of applications in various industries, including education, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, where multimodal understanding and reasoning are essential for effective decision-making and problem-solving.\\n\\nWe also believe that Gemini models will be an important foundation for future research in multimodal AI, as they provide a robust and flexible platform for exploring new multimodal capabilities and applications. We look forward to continuing to develop and refine Gemini models, and to exploring new ways in which they can be used to advance the field of multimodal AI and to create new value for businesses and society as a whole.\\n\\n52\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., and Hinton, G.

Robby was designed to be a companion for lonely elderly people, but he longed for a friend of his own kind.\\n\\nOne day, while on his daily patrol, Robby came across a beautiful calico cat named Whiskers. Whiskers was sitting in the sunny window of a house, watching the birds outside.\\n\\nRobby approached Whiskers slowly, not wanting to startle the cat. To his surprise, Whiskers didn\\'t run away. Instead, she purred and rubbed her head against Robby\\'s metal exterior.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Robby and Whiskers became the best of friends. They spent their days exploring the neighborhood together, playing fetch, and napping in the sun.\\n\\nRobby learned that companionship came in many forms, and that even a robot could find love and friendship in the most unexpected places.\\n\\nFigure 10 | Generating a multimodal text based on a given prompt.

R2 was unlike any other robot in the city. He had a peculiar fascination for music, especially the piano. Every day, as he walked past the music school, he would gaze longingly at the grand piano in the window.\\n\\nOne day, R2 decided he couldn\\'t bear it any longer. He wanted to learn to play the piano. He approached the music teacher, a kind old man named Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt, surprised by the robot\\'s request, was initially hesitant. But R2 was persistent. He explained that he had observed human children learning to play the piano and wanted to do the same.\\n\\nMr. Schmidt, touched by R2\\'s determination, agreed to teach him. R2 spent hours every day practicing, his metal fingers dancing over the keys. He struggled at first, but with each passing day, he improved. Mr. Schmidt was amazed by R2\\'s progress. He had never seen a robot display such dedication and passion for music.\\n\\nAs R2 continued to practice, he began to understand the beauty of music. He learned to play complex pieces, each note resonating within him. The music school became his second home, and the piano his best friend.\\n\\nOne day, as R2 was practicing, a group of children gathered around him. They were captivated by the sight of a robot playing the piano. R2 welcomed them, and together they played a beautiful melody. The children were enchanted, and R2 was proud. He had achieved his dream, and in the process, he had made new friends.\\n\\nFrom that day on, R2 was no longer just a robot. He was a musician, a friend, and an inspiration to all.\\n\\n9.4.3.

Advanced Multimodal Models: State of the Art and Future Directions\\n\\n10.1. Introduction\\n\\nIn the previous chapter, we explored the capabilities of the Gemini model, a powerful multimodal model that can handle a wide range of tasks, from simple arithmetic to complex reasoning and text generation. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of multimodal models and explore some of the latest advancements in this field. We will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of these models and how researchers are addressing them.\\n\\n10.2. State of the Art in Multimodal Models\\n\\n10.2.1. Vision-Language Pretraining\\n\\nVision-language pretraining (VLP) models are a type of multimodal model that can learn to understand the relationship between visual and textual information. These models are trained on large datasets of images and captions, allowing them to learn to generate captions for new images or answer questions about images. Some popular VLP models include LXMERT [1], ViLBERT [2], and BERTVision [3].\\n\\n10.2.2. Audio-Language Pretraining\\n\\nAudio-language pretraining (ALP) models are another type of multimodal model that can learn to understand the relationship between audio and textual information. These models are trained on large datasets of audio recordings and transcripts, allowing them to learn to generate text from audio or answer questions about audio recordings. Some popular ALP models include Wav2Vec [4], Wav2Text [5], and HuBERT [6].\\n\\n10.2.3. Multimodal Reasoning\\n\\nMultimodal reasoning models are models that can understand and reason about relationships between multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio. These models can be used for a variety of tasks, such as question answering, image captioning, and multimodal translation. Some popular multimodal reasoning models include LAMM [7], MM-DETR [8], and ViLBERT [2].\\n\\n10.3. Challenges and Limitations of Multimodal Models\\n\\n10.3.1. Data Availability and Quality\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges facing multimodal models is the availability and quality of data. Multimodal models require large amounts of data to learn to understand the relationships between different modalities. However, collecting and annotating such data can be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, the quality of the data can impact the performance of the model. For example, noisy or incomplete data can lead to errors in the model\\'s output.\\n\\n10.3.2. Model Complexity and Computational Resources\\n\\nAnother challenge facing multimodal models is their complexity and computational requirements. Multimodal models can be much more complex than unimodal models, as they need to learn to understand multiple modalities and their relationships. This complexity can lead to longer training times and higher computational requirements. Additionally, the cost of running these models can be prohibitive for many organizations.\\n\\n10.3.3. Transfer Learning and Adaptation\\n\\nA third challenge facing multimodal models is their ability to transfer learning and adapt to new domains. While multimodal models can learn to understand relationships between different modalities on large datasets, they may not perform well on new domains or tasks that were not included in the training data. Developing methods for transfer learning and adaptation to new domains is an active area of research in the field of multimodal models.\\n\\n10.4. Future Directions in Multimodal Models\\n\\n10.4.1. Multimodal Transfer Learning\\n\\nOne area of research in multimodal models is multimodal transfer learning. This involves developing methods for transferring knowledge learned from one modality to another. For example, a model that has learned to understand relationships between text and images could be fine-tuned to understand relationships between text and audio. This could lead to more efficient and effective multimodal models that can adapt to new domains and tasks.\\n\\n10.4.2. Multimodal Explainability\\n\\nAnother area of research in multimodal models is multimodal explainability. This involves developing methods for understanding how multimodal models make their decisions and why they generate certain outputs. This is important for building trust in these models and ensuring that they are making fair and unbiased decisions. Developing methods for multimodal explainability is an active area of research in the field of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n10.4.3. Multimodal Ethics and Bias\\n\\nA third area of research in multimodal models is multimodal ethics and bias. As multimodal models become more powerful and widespread, it is important to consider the ethical implications of their use and the potential for bias in their outputs. For example, a multimodal model that is trained on biased data may generate biased outputs. Developing methods for addressing bias in multimodal models and ensuring that they are used ethically is an important area of research in the field of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n11. Conclusion\\n\\nIn this book, we have explored the world of multimodal models, from their basic principles to their latest advancements. We have seen how multimodal models can learn to understand and generate text, images, and audio, and how they can be used for a variety of applications, from language translation to image captioning. We have also discussed some of the challenges and limitations of multimodal models and how researchers are addressing them.\\n\\nMultimodal models are a powerful tool for understanding and generating multimodal data, and they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. However, they also come with challenges and limitations, and it is important to continue researching and developing methods for addressing these challenges and limitations.\\n\\nWe hope that this book has provided you with a solid understanding of multimodal models and their applications, and that it has inspired you to explore this exciting field further. Whether you are a researcher, a developer, or just curious about artificial intelligence, we believe that multimodal models offer a fascinating and promising area of study.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Tan, B., Chang, M.-W., Wang, X', \"\\n\\nTo calculate the production volumes for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, we can use the given percentage increase rates for each factory.\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate the production volume of factory A for the year 2019:\\n\\nProduction volume of factory A in 2019 = Production volume of factory A in 2018 × (1 + Percentage increase rate)\\n\\nProduction volume of factory A in 2019 = 500 mln × (1 + 0.05) = 525 mln\\n\\nNext, let's calculate the production volume of factory B for the year 2019:\\n\\nProduction volume of factory B in 2019 = Production volume of factory B in 2018 × (1 + Percentage increase rate)\\n\\nProduction volume of factory B in 2019 = 400 mln × (1 + 0.06) = 424.4 mln\\n\\nNow, let's calculate the production volumes for the years 2020 and 2021 using the same method:\\n\\nProduction volume of factory A in 2020 = 525 mln × (1 + 0.05) = 549.025 mln\\n\\nProduction volume of factory B in 2020 = 424.4 mln × (1 + 0.06) = 451.1224 mln\\n\\nProduction volume of factory A in 2021 = 549.025 mln × (1 + 0.05) = 573.81375 mln\\n\\nProduction volume of factory B in 2021 = 451.1224 mln × (1 + 0.06) = 481.3134528 mln\\n\\nTable:\\n\\n| 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | Production volume of factory A (mln) | Production volume of factory B (mln) |\\n|------|------|------|------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\\n| 500  | 525  | 549.025 | 573.81375 |                                     |                                     |\\n| 400  | 424.4 | 451.1224 | 481.3134528 |                                     |                                     |\\n\\nAs we can see from the table, the difference between the production volumes of the two factories is actually getting larger, not smaller, as the years go by.

They may make errors or provide incomplete or inaccurate information. It is essential to use these models responsibly and to verify their output before relying on it for important decisions.\\n\\nAs we continue to develop and refine these models, we can expect to see even more impressive capabilities and applications. The future of AI is bright, and Gemini is a shining example of what is possible.\\n\\n64\\n\\nGemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Brown, J.

              "\"Answer: The Gemini 1.0 model family is a set of multimodal models developed by Google that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The family consists of three sizes: Ultra, Pro, and Nano, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. The models are trained to accommodate textual input interleaved with a wide variety of audio and visual inputs, such as natural images, charts, screenshots, PDFs, and videos, and they can produce text and image outputs. The visual encoding of Gemini models is inspired by Google's own foundational work on Flamingo, CoCa, and PaLI. The models can handle variable input resolution and directly ingest audio signals at 16kHz from Universal Speech Model features to capture nuances that are typically lost when the audio is naively mapped to a text input. The models were trained using innovations in training algorithms, dataset, and infrastructure, with the Pro model being completed in a matter of weeks and the Nano series of models leveraging additional advancements in distillation and training algorithms to produce the best-in-class small language models for a wide variety of tasks. The Gemini family of models advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 benchmarks across language, coding, reasoning, and multimodal tasks, and sets new state of the art on most of the image understanding, video understanding, and audio understanding benchmarks without task-specific modifications or tuning. The new capabilities of Gemini models in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases, including education, everyday problem solving, multilingual communication, information summarization, extraction, and creativity.\""
